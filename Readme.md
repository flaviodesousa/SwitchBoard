# Switchboard

This is an adaptation of the game *Switchbox*, published in the Issue 70 of the Compute! magazine [https://archive.org/details/1986-03-compute-magazine/page/n35/mode/2up].

The first step of this project is to have the original PC version running in [DOSBox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/). For supporting that the proofreader [original source](PROOFRDR.BAS) also published in that edition ([page 125](https://archive.org/details/1986-03-compute-magazine/page/n125/mode/2up)) was rewritten for Windows.
